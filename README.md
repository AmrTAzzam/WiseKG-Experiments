# WiseKG Experiments
This repository contains information and supplementary material about the WiseKG experiments.

The repository contains the following variables:
- logs: Containing the result logs from running the experiments
- figures: Containing the experimental figures from the paper and any figures that didn't make it into the paper
- scripts: Any scripts used (bash and so) to run the experiments

To run the experiments for WiseKG, build the project from https://github.com/WiseKG/WiseKG-Java and start the server (example configuration file is in 'scripts').
Use the bash scripts in the script directory to start the clients.

We downloaded the  [WatDiv Data](https://dsg.uwaterloo.ca/watdiv/) and the [DBpedia Data](https://wiki.dbpedia.org/dbpedia-dataset-version-2015-10) for usage in our experiments.
